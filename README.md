# Paint A Wave Function Collapse

This application is a basic implementation of the procedural image generation of the [Wave Function Collapse Algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/), made in Python's Pygame library. It allows the user to paint a sample tile and then procedurally generate a new, larger image based on the patterns extracted from the sample tile. 

Even though the application is written in Python, it has been compiled to WebAssembly and **is entirely accessible from within the browser, no Python installation reqiured!** (JavaScript needs to be enabled)
